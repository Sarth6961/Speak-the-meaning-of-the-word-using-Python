# Speak-the-meaning-of-the-word-using-Python
## Working
As mentioned above, by the combination of two modules we will generate the functionality required and to do that the following steps were taken:

1) A method is defined to make the system search for the meaning of the word provided as input
2) Another method is defined to make the system say out loud the output generated corresponding to the input provided.
3) The output returned in this may be a dictionary, so we have to extract each meaning of the word provided as it will be in a key-value format.
